# HR Attrition Dashboard

## Project Purpose

The HR Attrition Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of employee turnover within our organization. This tool tracks and analyzes various metrics related to HR attrition, with the aim of identifying patterns and root causes of employee turnover. With this dashboard, we endeavor to inform our retention strategies and enhance our workplace environment.

## Project Description

The dashboard is a visual tool that compiles attrition data into an interactive format, allowing for quick insights and analysis. It features several components:

- **Overall Attrition Metrics**: Displays total employee count, attrition numbers, and rate.
- **Department-wise Attrition**: A pie chart breaking down attrition percentages by department.
- **Age Group Distribution**: A bar chart showing the number of employees within specified age ranges.
- **Gender and Age Group Attrition**: Pie charts illustrating attrition rates by gender within various age groups.
- **Job Satisfaction Ratings**: A detailed table presenting satisfaction levels across different job roles.
- **Education-wise Attrition**: A pie chart indicating attrition percentages based on the employees' education levels.

## Objectives

- To measure and understand the attrition rate within the company.
- To identify which departments and demographics are most affected by turnover.
- To explore the correlation between attrition and factors like education, age, gender, and job satisfaction.
- To use these insights to develop and implement effective employee retention strategies.

## Achievements

Through the implementation of the HR Attrition Dashboard, we have achieved:

- Calculation of key attrition metrics: Total employees (1,470), attrition count (237), and attrition rate (16.12%).
- Identification of R&D as the department with the highest attrition rate.
- Analysis of employee age distribution, highlighting a concentration in the 25-34 age group.
- Insight into gender differences in attrition, noting a higher rate among males.
